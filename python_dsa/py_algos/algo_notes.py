# 1. Start at beginning
# 2. Compare current value to target
# 3. Move sequentially
# 4. Reach end of list
# Otherwise, return nothing

 # GUIDELINES FOR ALGORITHMS
# - Specific order is VERY important
# - Each step should be explicitly clear and can't be broken down further. Must be distinct.
# - Algorithm must produce a result
# - Algorithms should actually complete and not take an infinite amount of time.
# Overall 
# - An Algorithm needs a clearly defined problem statement, input, and output.
# - The steps in the algorithm need to be in a very specific order.
# - The steps also need to be distinct.
# - The algorithm should produce a result.
# - The algorithm should complete in a finite amount of time.

# N = number of values in a worst case scenario
# Number of tries before reaching solution = Total Runtime
# Big O - Order of Growth - A notation used to describe complexity (of the upper bounds). (Order of magnitude of complexity)
