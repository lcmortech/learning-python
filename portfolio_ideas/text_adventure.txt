Story: 
You are on your way back from work as a cashier at the local general store in your small store. The skies are overcast and the bus you normally take is longer than usually to arrive. 

Routes:
- Wait for the bus
- Decide to walk the extra mile
- Walk back to the store and stay the night


- Stay on main path or take a shortcut through the quarry
- Stop to take a closer look or continue on your way
- Contact the police or pretend you didn't see anything. Give it a proper burial (it's the least you can do)
- Take selfies with it, like a now-infamous social media influencer

Choices:
- will have an id
- some kind of simple code system: ex - #123 (route 1, choice 2, choice 3)
- or, will be stored in a object/dictionary/json

Player:
- will be a class
- Methods

State Management:
- Persisted using local or session storage (early version)
